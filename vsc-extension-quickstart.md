# Welcome to VS Code Prettify Selected JSON Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for developing and packaging the extension
* `package.json` - describe the extension, compilation scripts and lists the dependencies,
* `src/extension.ts` - expose the commands to be called in VS Code,
* `src/JsonPrettifier.ts` - implements the actual JSON prettifier.

## Get up and running straight away
* press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* run your command from the command palette by pressing (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and typing `Prettify selected JSON`
* set breakpoints in your code inside the sources to debug the extension

## Make changes
* changes can be made via pull requests but should always stick to the original purpose of the extension
